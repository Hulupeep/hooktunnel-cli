# HookTunnel CLI

**Webhook infrastructure that never drops a request.**

Webhooks are the weakest link in every platform integration. HookTunnel fixes that — reliable ingress, full history, instant replay. For development and production.

```bash
npx hooktunnel-cli connect dev 3000
```

---

## The Problem

Webhooks are fire-and-forget. When they fail, you're blind.

```
Provider ──────────────────────────────────▶ Your Server
              If down, webhook lost forever       💀
```

**Every team hits these:**

| Failure Mode | What Happens |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Server down** | Webhook gone. Stripe retries 8x, GitHub gives you 1 shot. |
| **Handler bug** | You need the exact payload to debug. It's gone. |
| **URL changed** | Redeployed? New infra? Webhooks silently fail. |
| **No visibility** | Something broke. What was in that payload? Who knows. |
| **Can't replay** | Fixed the bug, but need to wait for a real event to test. |

**Traditional tools don't solve this:**

| Tool | Problem |
|------|---------|
| **ngrok** | URL changes on restart. Dev only. No history. |
| **localtunnel** | Unstable. No persistence. Dev only. |
| **RequestBin** | View-only. Can't forward or replay. |
| **Custom logging** | You built it. You maintain it. It's missing features. |

## The Solution

HookTunnel is infrastructure between providers and your servers.

```
              WITHOUT                              WITH HOOKTUNNEL

Provider ────────▶ Your Server        Provider ────▶ HookTunnel ────▶ Your Server
        (if down, lost)                            (always on)      (can be down)
                                                    ✓ Captured       ✓ Process later
                                                    ✓ Logged         ✓ Debug anytime
                                                    ✓ Replayable     ✓ Test fixes
                                                    ✓ Stable URL     ✓ Redeploy freely
```

**What you get:**

- **Stable URLs** — Configure once in Stripe/Twilio/GitHub. Never change again.
- **Never lose webhooks** — Captured even when your server is down.
- **Full history** — See every request. Search by content. Debug with context.
- **Instant replay** — Re-send any webhook to test your fix. No waiting.
- **Local forwarding** — Forward to localhost for development.

## Use Cases

### Development: Forward to Localhost

Test against real webhooks while building:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Your server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Forward webhooks to localhost
hooktunnel connect dev 3000
```

Every Stripe/Twilio webhook instantly hits your local machine.

### Production: Debug Incidents

2am. Payments are failing. What's in those webhooks?

```bash
# See what's hitting your webhook endpoint
hooktunnel logs abc123 --limit 50

# Find the problematic request
# Note the log ID of the 500 error

# After fixing, replay to verify
hooktunnel replay log_xyz123 --to https://your-server.com/webhook
```

### Recovery: Server Was Down

Your server crashed for 10 minutes. Providers sent webhooks. They're not lost.

```bash
# See what came in while you were down
hooktunnel logs abc123 --limit 100

# Everything is there
# Process them now, or replay to your recovered server
```

### AI-Assisted Debugging

Use with Claude Code for intelligent troubleshooting:

**Prompt:** *"Use hooktunnel to find recent webhook errors and explain what's wrong"*

```bash
# Claude runs:
hooktunnel logs abc123 --limit 20

# Analyzes the 500 errors
# Explains what payload caused failure
# Suggests fixes
```

**Prompt:** *"Replay the failed payment webhook and debug my handler"*

```bash
# Claude runs:
hooktunnel replay log_abc123 --to http://localhost:3000

# Shows the response
# Explains the error
# Helps you fix it
```

```

1. **Provider sends webhook** to your stable HookTunnel URL
2. **HookTunnel captures and logs** — stored even if your server is down
3. **Request forwarded** to your server (or CLI for local dev)
4. **Full history available** — debug, search, replay anytime

The URL never changes. No webhook is ever lost.

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication required"

```

### "Connection failed"

1. Check internet connection
2. Verify API key: `hooktunnel status`
3. Try verbose mode: `hooktunnel connect dev 3000 --verbose`

### 502 errors in terminal

Your local server isn't responding:
1. Make sure it's running
2. Check the port number
3. Verify it's listening on localhost

### "Pro tier required"

Replay requires Pro. Upgrade at [hooktunnel.com/#pricing](https://hooktunnel.com/#pricing)
